# Reflection on the Home-Lab
I was able to get everthing up and running
At first I had a DCHP problem, which I resolved by reconfiguring the name server (I noted it in my tech journal)
I also had a wireguard problem, because I set up the vyOS vm to find out wireguard isn't on it, so I had to go get the rolling release iso 
in order to get it to work. 
I enjoyed this lab, it reminded me of a simplified SEC350
