# Mistakes
Firstly, Pippin should not have set up an anonymous user on the FTP server it allowed for sensitive information to be leaked.
Secondly, the media wiki page had edit access 
Thirdly, the localsettings.php file was extremely exposed and should have been more secure
Fourthly, the same password should not be used for multiple accounts
Fifthly, ssh should be disabled and port 22 should be closed
Sixthly, a password policy should be put into effect and one that is alot more secure than what it is now

# Difficulties
A few areas I struggled in were navigating mysql and finding that original hash value.
I was very unsure about how mediawikis user_name and user_password turned into the root ssh password
And how come the original hash value had Pippin at the start of it.
And lastly, I was unsure about how installing the back door led to use being able to do command execution. I understand the scipt does it but how?
