# Problem's & Solution's

> The first problem we ran into was outputting the data into our sweep.txt
- To fix this we added ">> sweep.txt" and then when we ran the code we did ./sweep.sh > sweep.txt

> The second problem, was the final nmap_IP_outputter, here we could not get the output to print just the IP's
- To fix this we printed the 5th element (the IPs) in the result of the grep

# Lab 2.1 Port Scanner

In this lab, we searched for open TCP ports. We used nmap to run a scan on a single port.
We then used wireshark to compare results of nmap scans with and without sudo permissions.


# Lab 2.2 Port Scanner

In this lab, we learned to use remmina to host an RDP session from Kali to Windows 10.
We then deep dove into nmap.
We learned:
- Version Detection (-sv)
- OS Detection (-A)
- Script Scanning (-A)
- traceroute (-A)
We learned how to run an nmap scan on a range of ports:
sudo nmap x.x.x.x -p 1-6000
And how to run an nmap scan on specified ports
sudo nmap x.x.x.x -p 135,139,445,3389
