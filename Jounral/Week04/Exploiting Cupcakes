# This was my first hack ever and it went how I expected it to go
It was pretty difficult at times and other times it seemed simplistic
One of the hardest ideas in this lab was how everything fit together.

We preformed researcher and then we began running scripts and other things and next thing you know I felt like we were in.
I mostly used the curl command to parse through folders.
    I released the first part of the command we would go to the bin where a command lives to use it and then mark the target directory.
    I have never used hydra and so the concept was new to me.

Questions:
   And I still am confused of the rockyou document.
   I understood this document had many passwords and we took anything realted to samwise out
        But how would we obtain a file like that in the real world?
        Further, I would like to research shellshock because I still am confused to how we used it.

Research:
    Shell Shock:
    https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/48112
    This vulnerability in Bash allows remote code execution without confirmation. A series of random
    characters, () { :; }; , confuses Bash because it doesn't know what to do with them, so by default, it
    executes the code after it

    From my researcher it seems shell shock can allow for attackers to gain access to an entire system and be able to look at and search for any file on a system.
    This is a very powerful attack and can cause major damage.
    (This makes sense for how we got the syntax of the curl command!)

    Hydra:
    https://www.kali.org/tools/hydra/
    Hydra is a basically a login cracker that uses many protocols. Super fast and flexible
    Protocols include:
    Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, FTP, HTTP(S)-FORM-GET,
    HTTP(S)-FORM-POST, HTTP(S)-GET, HTTP(S)-HEAD, HTTP-Proxy,
    ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MS-SQL, MySQL, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, PC-Anywhere,
    PC-NFS, POP3, PostgreSQL, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, SIP, SMB(NT), SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5,
    SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, Teamspeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.
    From my researcher, it seems that it is a password cracker and a good one at that.
    Which makes sense because we used it with the possible password file and were able to get into the system.
