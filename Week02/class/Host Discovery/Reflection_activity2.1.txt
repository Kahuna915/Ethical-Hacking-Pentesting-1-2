# Problem's & Solution's

> The first problem we ran into was outputting the data into our sweep.txt
- To fix this we added ">> sweep.txt" and then when we ran the code we did ./sweep.sh > sweep.txt

> The second problem, was the final nmap_IP_outputter, here we could not get the output to print just the IP's
- To fix this we printed the 5th element (the IPs) in the result of the grep
